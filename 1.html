<p><strong><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-html5-20110405/" target="_blank" title="html5 specification">Atoms</a></strong> is a <u>free</u> and open-source text and source code editor for <u>macOS, Linux, and Microsoft Windows</u>
 with support for plug-ins written in JavaScript, and embedded Git Control. Developed by GitHub, Atom is a desktop application built using web technologies.
Most of the extending packages have free software licenses and are community-built and maintained. Atom is based on Electron (formerly known as Atom Shell), a framework that enables cross-platform desktop applications using Chromium and Node.js.Atom was initially written in CoffeeScript and Less, but much of it has been converted to JavaScript.</p>

<p style="margin-top:40px;">Atoms is a "hackable" text editor, which means it is customizable. There is an init script one can customize using CoffeeScript, a style sheet to customize the looks of Atom, and a keymap to map or re-map key combinations to commands. One can even make a package to wrap all of this functionality into a single package, written in their choice of CoffeeScript or JavaScript.</p>
